What is a Digital Garden?

I love this definition from [Maggie's A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):
> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organised by their publication date. They’re inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren’t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They’re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we’re used to seeing.

For me, its a place where one can present to the world as what we most trully are
in our inner core: imperfect and changing, sometimes to what's considered "the best"
sometimes to what's considered "the worst". But the change is the only constant in everyone's life.

Being so, its just amazing to see around us and notice how much of this imperfection
is being hidden away! Most of the time to the detriment of the individual, and most surely
to the detriment of the society.

Less and less people are willing to create because of the fear from the public shame.

Well, this webpage is my living protest against the societal pressures to be perfect. Come! And explore my imperfections!
For the good of us all.

And here, take this cat:
