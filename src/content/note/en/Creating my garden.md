# Creating my garden  
As its already showed up, even in here, sometimes its hard for me to keep consistency  
I initially had a lot of cool ideas to implement here, and to express my self!  
Even just thinking about it right now makes me feel somewhat of a sense of interestingness??  
  
Anyways, all that is to say, that one very important thing for me when starting new projects  
its being able to take them back a month later and still have it working, and remembering   
at what point I was.  
  
For this, several things has helped me:  
- Obsidian notes with logs of each work I'm doing at the time  
- A strong, but flexible, framework, like this one I'm using!  
- Git... Definitely git.  
  
# So...  
Im still figuring things around, moving things from here to there, trying things just to tear them down  
and start from zero! Sometimes I get into a mind trap, and reflect about... Is it doing this   
kind of stuff, this "expresive" stuff, just walking in circles if you never end up *producing*  
something?  
But deep down, I know that, that voice is just interiorized thoughts from the system. There's no such thing  
as a perfect circle. Eventually you'll draw a different circle, and maybe you'll like that one better!  
  
That's what matters!
