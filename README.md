# My Digital Garden

Hi, you!

This is my personal digital garden built with [AstroJS](), using the theme
[ThoughtLite]().

I believe in the values behind learning in public and sharing knowledge as a way of
improving it. Following on the steps of [Maggie Appleton](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
I decided to start my own!

Be aware, this will be messy, as all things in nature are.

Fell free to wander in my garden.
