# kev's digital garden

After being inspired by the ideas of [Maggie Appleton](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
I've decided to start my own digital garden!

I want this to be a place of public growth for my ideas,
where I expose them to air and the sun, curate them, and care for this space.

It will become messy, as all things in nature do.

Feel free to wander in my garden.
